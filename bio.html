HREF="http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~brad"> Brad Carlin</A>** on my
dissertation "Efficient Perfect and MCMC Sampling Methods for Bayesian
Spatial and Components of Variance Models" (see my <a

</a>).  I worked on computation for Bayesian spatial models and some
hierarchical models. In particular, I investigated sampling techniques
for hierarchical models that use Gaussian Markov Random Fields
(GMRFs). A major portion of my thesis contains work on perfect
sampling approaches for Bayesian disease mapping models. For more on
perfect sampling, see D.B.Wilson's <A Href =
"http://dbwilson.com/exact/"> website </A>.  While in graduate school,
I also studied hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques used for
disease mapping and particulate matter exposure studies. As a
postdoctoral fellow I studied statistical approaches for software
engineering problems.  <br> <br>

<HR> <font size=4> Research Interests
</FONT> <br>

<UL>
<LI>  <b> Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms </b>  <br>

MCMC algorithms are very widely used for both Bayesian and frequentist
statistical inference.<!-- It is typically difficult to design MCMC
--> <!-- algorithms that are generally efficient even for fairly
narrow classes --> <!-- of models. --> I am interested in designing
algorithms that have good properties so they produce accurate
estimates quickly. I am particularly interested in algorithms that are
automated, that is, where the user needs to provide minimal input.
<UL>

<LI> Exact/perfect sampling: This is a sophisticated class of
algorithms that use Markov chains to produce i.i.d. draws from the
target distribution. It has generally been difficult to get this to
work for non-toy Bayesian models. I have worked on implementing these
for a class of Gaussian Markov random field models.

<LI> Stopping rules and standard errors for MCMC:
 My collaborators and I have shown that using a <i> consistent
batch means </i> estimate of standard errors and then using the
standard errors as a criteria for stopping an MCMC run works well
 in theory and practice.

<LI> Fast mixing algorithms: I have worked on designing MCMC
algorithms that explore the state space quickly, demonstrating their
effectiveness via empirical studies and theoretical results wherever
possible.

<LI> Parallel computing: With Matt Tibbits (Ph.D. student)
and John Liechty, I have recently been working on constructing MCMC algorithms that exploit the
latest in parallel computing resources.

</UL>

<LI>  <b> Spatial models </b> <br>

<UL>

<LI> Spatial models for non-Gaussian data: I am working on modeling and computation for `automodels' and spatial generalized linear mixed models for spatially dependent data that are non-Gaussian, for e.g. spatial binary (0-1) data, count data, and zero-inflated data.

</ul>

<LI> <b> Complex computer models: emulation, calibration, model averaging </b>  <br> 

<UL>

<LI> Computer experiments: complex computer models increasingly have output that is in the form of spatial fields. There are computational and modeling challenges involved in parameter inference/calibration based on such computer model output and physical observations of the process being modeled by the computer model. I have been working on flexible and computationally efficient approaches for these problems.

<LI> Often multiple computer models are available for the same phenomenon.  Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is an approach that allows for information from multiple models to be combined in a probabilistic fashion. I have worked on BMA approaches for computer models with spatial output.

</UL>

<LI> <b> Interdisciplinary work in environmental and ecological
statistics </b> <br> My methodological work in this area is motivated
by the challenge of carrying out statistical inference when the
scientific models, questions and data sets are complex. Statistical
computing and spatial modeling often play crucial roles in these
projects.

<!-- I am interested in interdisciplinary research and have worked with -->
<!-- environmental scientists at the <a href="http://enhs.umn.edu/"> School -->

<!-- multiple collaborations at Penn State with:  -->
